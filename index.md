## About 
My name is Modhuparna Manna, known to most people as Modhu. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science (with a concentration in cybersecurity) at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA. I am advised by Golden G. Richard III, Professor of Computer Science at LSU, and co-advised by Andrew Case and Aisha Ali-Gombe. I am a part of the Applied Cybersecurity Research Lab at CCT in LSU. &nbsp;  
Recently, I have taken up the position of Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of New Haven in West Haven, CT. I teach cybersecurity courses like cyber forensics and reverse engineering. I am actively involved in cybersecurity researh at LSU and UNH. My research interests span over areas including application security, memory forensics, digital forensics, malware analysis, and reverse engineering.
